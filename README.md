# Classic Cars Website

This is a classic car website I created as my first web development project. It was a challenging experience as I was just starting out with web development, but I learned a lot throughout the process.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the website and creating a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic features to the website.
- **Bootstrap**: For creating a responsive design and ensuring the website works well on all devices.

### Features:
- Responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- Interactive design elements powered by JavaScript.
- Clean and simple design, focusing on classic cars.

### Future Improvements:
- Plan to convert the website into a multi-page site with more features.
- Improve the functionality and design based on user feedback.

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohadese36/Classic-Cars-Website.git
